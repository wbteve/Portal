-----
- changes related to bandwidth detection compatibility

3.1.4
-----
Fixes:
- Now resets the bufferStart value to zero when replaying a clip. Because it failed to reset it the buffer bar and
  progress bar were not drawn correctly when replaying.

-----
- Supports connection redirects as described here: http://www.wowzamedia.com/forums/showthread.php?t=6206#2
- New configuration option 'connectionArgs' that accepts an array of arguments to be passed to NetConnection.connect().
  This is needed for example with the Internap CDN.
- Now correctly recognizes fully qualified RTMP clip urls (no need to specify netConnectionUrl separately)

3.1.2
-----
- compatible with the new ConnectionProvider and URLResolver API
- Starts RTMP and RTMPT connection attempts in parallel. The one who succeeds first will be used and the other one is discarded.
  The approach is described here: http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/185/tn_18537.html#http_improv
